# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, and Iâ€™d love to hear your suggestions or improvements! Even though itâ€™s a simple script, every contribution will be thoughtfully considered.

If you're interested in contributing, here are some areas where your help would be especially valuable:
- Improving the scriptâ€™s **user experience**.
- Adding support for **new Linux distributions**.
- Implementing **new features** that enhance the scriptâ€™s functionality.
- Suggesting improvements for **error handling** or **debugging tools**.
